# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game using Minimax algorithm
This is a tic tac toe game that I made that uses the minimax algorithm. I used python to write the algorithm and used javascript for the rest.

# Steps to run
In order to run the game I used flask for the backend. The tictactoe.py file is the app file used for flask. Simply run 
a flask development server with you FLASK_APP variable set to tictactoe.py
